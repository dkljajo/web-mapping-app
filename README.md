# web-mapping-app

In this project I created an interactive HTML map with two different layers:

1. World population distribution visible in a color range scale (yellow < 10 M, orange between 10 M and 20 M, and red with over 20 M people);
2. Locations of Volcanoes in US territory, where at each of them a colorful pin displays its MSL.
3. On the top-right corner of the map is a layer control which allows to chose which layer has to be displayed.

# How to run the app:
1. Clone git repo https://github.com/vbb08/web-mapping-app
2. Python 3.11 or newer version required!
3. Run Map.py file
4. Open Map1.html generated file, in your browser
